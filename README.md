### Hi there 👋

💬 I'm Pierre, and I work hard to become a web developer.  
  
🌱 I’m currently learning web development at O'clock school  
📱 I was Community Manager & Social Media Manager for 7 years in communications agencies  
📚 I love learning new things and web development has always attracted me, so... I decided to take the plunge and here I am !  
📄 I will put some projects online on my GitHub to keep track of my progress. I am open to any comments that can help me improve.  
  
🥰 I think I already have a big preference for backend development.
