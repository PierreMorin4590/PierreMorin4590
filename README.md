### Hi there 👋

💬 I'm Pierre, and I'm working hard to become a web developer.  
🤓 Currently, I'm learning **React** as a self-taught student.  
  
🌱 I learned web development at O'clock school.  
👨🏻‍🎓 I obtained my Professional Title DWWM in July 2024.  
📱 I worked as a Community Manager & Social Media Manager for 7 years in communications agencies.  
📚 I love learning new things, and web development has always attracted me, so... I decided to take the plunge, and here I am !  
📄 I will put some projects online on my GitHub to keep track of my progress. I am open to any comments that can help me improve.  
  
🥰 I think I already have a big preference for backend development.
